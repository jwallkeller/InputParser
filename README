The name of the file to run is a Python file and is named DefMethodCodeTest.py

This project was created using Python 3.9.2

The project uses these libraries from Python:
sys
os
datetime
re

TO RUN:

It takes one command line argument which is the path to the directory containing the input text files

Example: python ./DefMethodCodeTest.py C:/Desktop/DefMethodCodeTest/def-method-code-test-input-files

TESTS

Included in this zipped archive are folders containing various tests:

1) an empty directory
	(TO RUN TEST: python DefMethodCodeTest.py /path/to/def-method-code-test-input-files-empty)
2) a directory of non-.txt files
	(TO RUN TEST: python DefMethodCodeTest.py /path/to/def-method-code-test-input-files-non-text)
3) a directory with .txt that have no corresponding delimiters
	(TO RUN TEST: python DefMethodCodeTest.py /path/to/def-method-code-test-input-files-bad-delimeters)

The file also detects if too many or no arguments are passed.

The file also detects if the directory given exists.

For each corresponding delimiter (comma, pipe, and space), the file is looking for the exact format provided.
If it cannot find a provided format, it will alert the user.

Automating the code tests would be the most efficient way to test. Whether that be included in this program or having
a service dedicated to doing so is up for debate. I tried to account for all of the possibilities as I could think of.
